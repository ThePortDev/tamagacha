We think, sometimes we wonder. Dogs have been man's best friend since the beginning, if man's best friend means eating your food and destroying your garbage cans. Proceed with caution if you are a mail deliverer by trade, or if you are old. Those are both extremely threatening to dogs."),

This is one wild bird and it will not be easy to love, but worth it because it's cute bird."),

Will most likely shove glasses off of counters or tables when not looked at, otherwise will make eye contact throughout it's evil deeds. They say all dogs go to heaven, so where do cats go?"),

Is it empty space? Humanity will never know. Also how the fish survives without any actual water is beyond us."),

This pet is quite rare. Only obtained in explicit and illegal ways. Due to such difficulties, only super rich people tend to take care of them. To be honest, its not a great pet, it jiggles and makes super gross sounds.")
